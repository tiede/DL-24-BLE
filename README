# DL-24 BLE Logger

This is a simple Python script that logs data from a DL-24 BLE device.

I have found other repositories but could not get any of them working with my version of the Atorch DL-24 BLE device.

The protocol seems to have changed and the repositories I found were not updated.

## Prerequisites
